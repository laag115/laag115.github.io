        <h2>Seriously, what else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p> Yes I stole this code from the internet, but great artists steal right? Just look at: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Taylor Swift </li>
            <li>Drake</li>
            <li>Kenny G</li>
            <li>DJ Khaled</li>
            <li>Luis Gomez</li>
            <li>Charlie Parker</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>I have good taste!</h2>
  
        <p> If you know where this code is from, then you know I know where this code is from. And if we both know where this code is from then we BOTH have good taste, and we'll probably like each ohter.</p>
